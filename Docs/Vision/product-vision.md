# Product Vision

## One-liner
SVR (Stress-Validated Readiness) turns preparedness from “completed training” into **verified performance under pressure**.

## The core thesis
Most organizations can prove that employees **watched** training or **passed** quizzes, but they can’t prove that employees can **execute** procedures when alarms are sounding and stress disrupts decision-making. SVR closes that gap by running short readiness audits in realistic simulations, measuring behavior, and producing audit-grade evidence.

## What SVR is
SVR is an **audit-first readiness system** that repeatedly measures real performance and improves it over time using a tight feedback loop:

**Audit → Measure → Score → Report → Correct → Re-audit**

- **Audit:** short, unannounced readiness check (surprise initiation)
- **Measure:** objective behavioral telemetry (timing, decisions, protocol adherence, critical errors)
- **Score:** deterministic Readiness Score with explainable breakdowns
- **Report:** after-action report that is legible to leadership and defensible for compliance/risk
- **Correct:** minimal, failure-specific reinforcement only where breakdowns occur
- **Re-audit:** verify improvement and track trends over time

## What SVR is not
- Not a generic VR training library
- Not “course completion” software
- Not a medical or diagnostic system
- Not a one-off simulation experience

## Primary customers and value
SVR serves leaders accountable for preparedness and liability:
- Risk & Compliance
- EHS / Safety
- Emergency Management
- Security / Campus Safety
- HR Compliance (for policy scenarios)

Core value delivered:
- **Evidence:** defensible proof of readiness beyond completion records
- **Actionability:** identifies failure modes and what to fix
- **Efficiency:** short sessions reduce downtime vs. facility-wide drills
- **Accountability:** measurable improvement over time

## Product principles
1. **Deterministic scoring:** pass/fail and scores must be reproducible and explainable.
2. **Telemetry-first:** every conclusion ties back to logged, timestamped events.
3. **Pilot-friendly:** offline-first, low friction, minimal sensitive data.
4. **Platform-agnostic core:** desktop now; XR later without rewriting the engine.
5. **Data-driven scenarios:** scenario/rubric/microdrills defined in text (versionable).
